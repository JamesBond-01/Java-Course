Practice example 2: Nested if ()

Criteria to play football at an academy is that age should be greater than 16 and height should be greater than 167 cm.

Write a program which does the following:

    Accept the user's age.

    Accept user’s height in cm.

    If age is greater than 16 and height is greater than 167, display a message “You are qualified to play”.

    If age is greater than 16 but height is <167, display a message that “You are not qualified to play”

    If age is less than 16 and height is >167 or<167 then display a message that says “You are not qualified as of now,
    come back after X years” Where X is the difference between 16 and user’s current age.
