Practice Example 5: Product Discount Calculator Using For Loop & Array

Practice example 5: Arrays and loops, product discount calculator.

You are given prices of a couple of products and those prices are stored in an array titled “ticket_price”.

This is what the array looks like: int ticket_price[] ={100,150,500,20};

You now need to calculate the discounted price for each item, depending on the percent discount entered by the user.

For example, if the user enters the value of discount percentage as 10, you need to discount the price from the above
array by 10%.

You need to store these values inside a new array and finally print all the elements of the new array which contains
the discounted prices.

This is what the output should look like:
90
135
450
18

The mathematical formula for calculating the discounted price is as follows:

Discounted_price = current_price - (current_price * discount_percentage)/100

Hint & steps:

    Prompt the user to enter the discount percentage and save it.

    Traverse the ticket_price array to access price of each individual item.

    Calculate the discounted price on every single item.

    Save that discounted price into the discounted_price array.

    Traverse the discounted price array and display its contents.
