Practice Example 6: Accept Multiple Values Using Loops & Scanner

Practice example 6: Using loops to accept multiple values from the user:

As we know a scanner can be used to accept data from the user, but the scanner can only accept one value at a time.

We also know that loops can be used to repeat a set of instructions/code.

Try to nest a scanner inside a for loop to accept multiple values from user using the following steps:

    Ask the user the number of values he wishes to enter.

    Depending on the number of values, accept the same number of values from the user using a scanner and a for loop.
    Eg if the user enters the number 2, accept 2 values from the user and store them in an array.

    Display those values inside the array back to the user.
